If you are new to GitHub or running python code, this note will explain how to do actually play the game.

Before you can run Python code on your PC, you need to install the latest version of Python, you can find it here: https://www.python.org/downloads
Also make sure to set your environment variables to that python version, that is too complicated to type down here so whatch a youtube tutorial about it or smth

When the zip file is installed, unzip it. There should be a folder with the same name now in your downloads (or wherever you chose the folder to be)

Go inside the folder and right click on empty space. An option in the drop-down menu should be "Open in Terminal". This is where you give your computer the message to open the game.

If you don't allready have pyGame installed, install it by typing in the terminal:
pip install pygame
this may not work, in case of this not working, type:
python -r pip install pygame

After you are sure you have installed pygame properly, in the terminal, run:
python game.py

It should bring up options of customizing settings, so follow along with them to customize the game.

Thats all i think it should work. if not then just copy and paste the error into google or chatgpt or smth :/
yeh thanks for checking out my lil project ok thanks bye.
